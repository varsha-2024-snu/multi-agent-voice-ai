Ai voice/audio agents:
Audio processing:
It is the use of ai to interpret and manipulate audio signals.
Earlier it used to be just basic sound analysis, now it has evolved to intelligent systems that can recognise speech, generate music and even understand emotions.

Brief history:
-> 1950: digital audio synthesis begins
-> 1970; early speech synthesis
-> 1990: machine learning introduced
-> 2010”: deep learning evolution starts

Cnn (convolutional neural networks): they extract patterns from raw data
Rnn (recurrent neural network) +LSTM: they understand the temporal relationships in speech.

Key concepts in modern day audio processing:
 fourier transformation and spectral analysis: 
-> they transform audio signal into smaller frequency componenets
-> they can identify musical notes or instruments
-> they can remove bg noise
-> they allow sound editing

Deep neural network:
-> tehy learn patterns in audio data through multiple layers
-> used in instrument reognitions, speech to text conversions, emotion detection and noise reduction

ASR (automatic speech recognition):
-> converts speech to text
-> so they help in voice commands, making audio transcriptions etc

Sound generation and music composition
            -> generative ai models learn audio patterns and creates new music on its own (eg: musicnet, jukebox)
           

Types of ai agents:
Simple reflex: respondes to direct commands only
Model based reflex: maintains internal states and adapts to changing environments
Goal based: plans and acts towards long term goals
Utility based: chooses best action based on outcomes
Learning agent: learns from experience and feedback

Llms are used as cognitive engines for text processing. They now act as reasoning agents.

Agentic ai patterns for enhanced reasoning:

Chain of thought: it breaks down the user problems into smaller ones step by step for logical reasoning

React: it combines both reading and action, it first thinks then acts

Tree of thought: it explores multiple reasoning paths to choose the best outcome.

Llms with tools: it uses and calls external tools like webseacrh, databases etc to enhance the output quality

ReWOO: it enhances the memory and modular reasoning by invoking reusable skills.

Ai voice agents have a lot of real world applications like:
-> customer services by automating faqs and handling calls
-> in healthcare by voice diagnostics and appointment
-> in finance by giving fraud alerts, account management
->in  accessibility by giving real time transcription
-> smart assistants for scheduling, reminders etc


Multi-turn conversation in voice AI

What exactly is a multi-turn conversation?
Multi-turn conversation is like a dialogue exchange flow between multiple agents and user. So overall it looks like a group of people having a natural discussion on a topic.

The agent here remembers the context, maintains flow and responds dynamically

Multi-turn conversations have:
Contextual understanding
Personalized and human like flow
More natural sounding convo
Lower training needs
